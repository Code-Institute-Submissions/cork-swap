            <br>
            <p>We're a group of Cork folks, who care about the planet and... looking great!

                You're tired of your wardrobe? 
                You don't really want to spend money? 
                You try to live more green? 
                
                Awesome! You're in the right place!
                
                We're organizing regular clothes swaps in Cork City. 
                You can easily refresh your look, update your wardrobe, get rid of the clothes you don't love anymore, and spend fun time with your friends browsing and trying on new things.  
                
                Be environmentally cautious, change your style as often as you want, and give your unwanted clothes new life. Sounds good? It sure does! Everyone swaps and share these days. Join us and enjoy sustainable fashion.</p>
